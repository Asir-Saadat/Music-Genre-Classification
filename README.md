# Music-Genre-Classification
This model was created by taking sounds from 10 different genres using .wav files and later sample rate and data was used as features. After that, it is used in a 
basic neural network and predictions were given. This project mainly focuses on the preprocessing of using audio/sound and how it can be implemented. The following
jupyter notebook can be imporved with better dataset and other models as well.
